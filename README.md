# Dating Deacons

Front end website for a friend's blind dating/charitable organization at Wake Forest, built mobile-first using Bootstrap. Check out [caberghausen.github.io/datingdeacons](https://caberghausen.github.io/datingdeacons/)! It also looks great on mobile.

This was the repo for the active site served over google domains from Sept 2020-Jan 2022, where Dating Deacons recorded I believe over 3000 unique signups through the site. The friend I made the project for since closed down the old domain (which was datingdeacons.org) when he moved on to a new job.
