# Dating Deacons

Front end website for a friend's blind dating/charitable organization at Wake Forest, built mobile-first using Bootstrap. Check out [caberghausen.github.io/datingdeacons](https://caberghausen.github.io/datingdeacons/)! It also looks great on mobile.<br>
This was the repo for the active site served over google domains from Sept 2020-Jan 2021. The friend I made the project for has now franchised the platform to other schools on a web app that's available at datingdeacons.org.
