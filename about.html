              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During the summer of 2019, I discovered my parents originally met on a blind date. Considering this, I realized it would be really fun to do something similar to this at Wake Forest: I've always enjoyed meeting new people and feel as though Wake can be somewhat restrictive socially after freshman year. I thought about creating a blind dating service, but realized I would need an "X factor", so to speak, if I wanted to compete with Bumble, Tinder, and other existent dating services on campus. While sitting in the waiting room for an eye doctor appointment (I have worn contacts since third grade), I realized how fortunate I was to always be able to afford new eyewear and get the care I needed. Combining two ideas, 'Blind Dating that supports the Blind' was born! I decided this program, called Dating Deacons, would be a non-profit service that would support OneSight, an organization committed to offering free vision care worldwide. In addition, I hoped the program's designation as a non-profit would make students more willing to participate, as each $3 charge per date would go to support charity. 
              <!-- ^ makes tab indent -->
              <br><br>
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After developing this idea throughout the fall semester, I pitched my plan to a group of 3 friends in January 2020 to enthusiastic support. We wanted to kick off the organization around Valentine's Day, so those without a significant other could enjoy the holiday with a new friend while simultaneously benefiting charity. We posted posters around campus, promoted our cause on Instagram, and told as many friends as we could, spreading the word about Dating Deacons. Despite all of this publicizing, none of us could have predicted the enormous response: we raised over $700 for OneSight, with close to 300 students participating. The initial results seemed like a recipe for success. However, the COVID-19 outbreak, and Wake Forest's subsequent shutdown, made all of our momentum come to a roaring halt. 
              <br><br>
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, the Dating Deacons team quickly realized this past fall that we could alter Dating Deacons' model to our "new normal" of social distancing on Wake's campus: isolated students were in more need of (safely) meeting people than ever before. At the semester's outset, I added six new students with differing backgrounds and experiences to my executive team. Additionally, we launched the datingdeacons.org website and completely rebranded the service as an easy, fun, and safe way to meet new people on a relatively locked-down campus. The rebranding included the creation of 'meme' videos about the Dating Deacons experience, photos and testimonials of real participants, and promotional events like free steak dinners. All of this served to publicize our service and generate traffic for our website and Instagram among students. By the end of the fall semester, we had initiated more than 210 total dates, raising over $1,000 for OneSight. Although we didn't reach our ambitious goal of 250 dates, the stories that came from some of the pairings, and joy these dates brought in such a challenging time, are what made all of our work throughout the semester worth it. One of our participants set up a folding table, chairs, and a birthday candle in the middle of the quad, and had a friend serve Chick-Fil-A to him and his date in a suit. Another pairing decided to do a double date with two of their respective friends and made the trek to a drive-through-zoo! But my favorite story, by far, was that one of my best girl friends started dating the guy I paired her with, whom she hadn't met before Dating Deacons. 
              <br><br>
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Moving into January and the Spring 2021 semester, I've already added 5 new members, all underclassmen, to join our executive team. It's my hope that this service will connect students for years to come, even after I––along with the majority of my original founding executives––graduate in a year and a half. Especially after this challenging semester, we've found a niche on campus as a brand that offers a safe and fun opportunity to meet a friend, while simultaneously supporting a worthy cause.
