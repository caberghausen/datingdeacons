                    "Over the summer I found that my own parents met on a blind date. I was dissapointed
                    by the lack of opportunities to do this on Wake's campus, and with help from a small
                    group of friends, we were able to make an algorithm that would allow similar people
                    from different groups on campus to meet each other. As for the cause that the proceeds
                    support, I am essentially blind without glasses and wanted to to help those less
                    fortunate get the benefit of clear vision as well."
